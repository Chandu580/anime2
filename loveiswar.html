          <h2>Story</h2>
          <p>Kaguya is the daughter of a wealthy conglomerate family, and Miyuki is the 
            top student at the school and well known across the prefecture. Although they
             like each other, they are too proud to confess their love, as they believe 
             whoever does so first would "lose" in their relationship.</p>
